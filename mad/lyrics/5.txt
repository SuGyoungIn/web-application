WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
When you call our name
WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
We are just the same
We ignore the waves and
We ignore the fire
HO HO HO HOO
We need a miracle
Watch over there
It disappears
We lose it all
And shed no tears
Behind the progress
Behind our walls
We had it all
And we want more
It's just a dream that turns into nightmare
THE FUTURE IS OURS WE RUN OUT OF TIME
(It's) Just a dream that turns into nightmare
WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
When you call our name
WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
We are just the same
We ignore the waves and
We ignore the fire
HO HO HO HOO
We need a miracle
We know it's bad
Then we forget
It's not our problem
It's not our fault
We know it's crazy
Now all is said
It's not a story
We have to change
It's just a dream that turns into nightmare
THE FUTURE IS OURS WE RUN OUT OF TIME
(It's) Just a dream that turns into nightmare
THE FUTURE IS NOW WHAT'S BEEN DONE SO FAR?
We will leave a silent world
WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
When you call our name
WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
We are just the same
We ignore the waves and
We ignore the fire
HO HO HO HOO
We need a miracle
We need a miracle
When the sunlight will go away
We'll stand here with nothing to say
When the ground will break away
We'll stand here with nothing to say
WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
When you call our name
WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
We are just the same
We ignore the waves and
We ignore the fire
HO HO HO HOO
We need a miracle
We need a miracle
WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
When you call our name
WE DON'T CARE
WE DON'T CARE
We are just the same
We ignore the waves and
We ignore the fire
HO HO HO HOO
We need a miracle
We need a miracle
WE NEED A MIRACLE
