[Chorus]:
Take my hand you'll be okay
Take my hand let come what may
Take my hand you'll be okay
Maybe we'll go there
Passionate affair

[Verse 1]:
Yah I'm on the track and I hit it fantastic
Gonna sell ‘em all gonna get that mad plastic
Yah stuck inside and I feel a tad spastic
Hunger never satisfied
Such a fat bastard

Raining never stopping
We stuck inside always poppin’
We made a lot of predictions
And most of them we are toppin’
We coming up with some more
We don't got the time to tour
In a couple years I'm hoping that maybe we aren't as poor

[Pre-Chorus]:
We built enough to know
We had to start again
To see the end, yeah
To see the end, yeah
Woah

You still won’t believe it though
They called your bluff again
So don’t pretend, yeah
So don’t pretend, yeah

Woah

[Chorus]

Take my hand you'll be okay
Take my hand let come what may
Take my hand you'll be okay
Maybe we'll go there
Passionate affair

[Verse 2]:
Yah they takin’ hands takin’ hands yah take ‘em all
Make a hundred bands hundred bands yah we make ‘em all
Never understand understand need tylenol
Lying on the gram on the gram gon' find ‘em all

Yah gettin’ messed up getting back up
Feeling more pain makin’ more rain
My attacks up
Rack ups won't pass up
What I got here
Bad cop so damn hot
He don't got fear
Passionate ration it
Bad for it mad for it
Overboard overlord
Show himself
On a poster board
[Pre-Chorus]:
We built enough to know
We had to start again
To see the end, yeah
To see the end, yeah

Woah

You still won’t believe it though
They called your bluff again
So don’t pretend, yeah
So don’t pretend, yeah

Woah

[Chorus]:
Take my hand you'll be okay
Take my hand let come what may
Take my hand you'll be okay
Maybe we'll go there
Passionate affair
