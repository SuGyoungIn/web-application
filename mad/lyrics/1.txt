Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm about to lose
I'm about to lose
I'm about to lose my mind
When you are by my side

[Chorus]
I'm alone
I'm addicted
To your love
But it's forbidden
I'm alone
It's time to be here
It's time to be alive

Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I see in you what no one sees
A thing will never be broken
Seems you don't know how it feels
Then I'm done I have spoken
[Chorus]
I'm alone
I'm addicted
To your love
But it's forbidden
I'm alone
It's time to be here
It's time to be alive

Yeah
Yeah (Repeat)
Oh (Repeat)
