Yeah, yeah

Monday morning, hate this feeling

Stuck at work staring at the ceiling
It's so plain and ordinary
Last place on Earth where we wanna be

The week is just so long
We can't wait to let it go
Our problem disappeared
We're not tied up anymore
The weekend is ours

Up and down, up and down
Can you fell it?
Up and down, up and down
Music's playing
Tonight we are awake
This is why we fuckin' hate Mondays

Up and down, up and down
Start bouncing
Up and down, up and down
Like a family
Sunday comes and we're sick and tired to say
God how much we fuckin' hate Mondays
Friday morning, can't control it
Fired up and counting every minute
Hands are shaking, eyes are burning
The time has come, yeah, this is not a warning

The week was just so long
We had to let it go
Our problems disappeared
We're not tied up anymore
The weekend is here
(Sunday comes, we are sick and tired to say)

Up and down, up and down
Can you fell it?
Up and down, up and down
Music's playing
Tonight we are awake
This is why we fuckin' hate Mondays

Up and down, up and down
Start bouncing
Up and down, up and down
Like a family
Sunday comes and we're sick and tired to say
God, how much we fuckin' hate Mondays
(Up and down, up and down)
(Start bouncing)
(Yeah, yeah)

Raise your hands in the air
Get your drinks, let the music play
Shake your heads, no regret
Tonight is ours, it's time to rage
Raise your hands in the air
Get your drinks, let the music play
Shake your heads, no regret
Tonight is ours, it's time to rage

(Up and down, up and down)
(Start bouncing)
(Up and down, up and down)
(Start bouncing)

Up and down, up and down
Can you fell it?
Up and down, up and down
Music's playing
Tonight we are awake
This is why we fuckin' hate Mondays

Up and down, up and down
Start bouncing
Up and down, up and down
Like a family
Sunday comes and we're sick and tired to say
God, how much we fuckin' hate mondays
Raise your hands in the air
Get your drinks, let the music play
Shake your heads, no regret
Tonight is ours, it's time to rage
Raise your hands in the air
Get your drinks, let the music play
Shake your heads, no regret
Tonight is ours, it's time to rage
God, how much we fuckin' hate Mondays
