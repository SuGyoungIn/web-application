Tipsy, walk in the party
Pumped up, look I'm so perky
Let's bond, pour me another one
Uptights all over the club
New goal? Cheer the place up
Coz I want it, and I feel it, and I need it now
There's a light in my eyes, and I can't see through
A venom in my blood so I don't feel blue
So I don't feel
There's a light in my eyes, and I can't see through
A venom in my blood so I don't feel blue
So I don't feel

(Blue) But the night is young
(Blue) But the night is young
Many things yet to be done for fun
Set the room on fire
(Blue) We could still get higher
This night should never end at all

Wasted, rocking the party
The question is if you can think about it
Am I about to lose control?
Sunrise, still at the party
This game is killing me softly
But I need it, yeah I need it, yeah I need it now
(Blue) But the night is young
(Blue) But the night is young
Many things yet to be done for fun
Set the room on fire
(Blue) We could still get higher
This night should never end at all
Dance with me, you, dance with me
Dance with me, this night should never end at all
Dance with me, you, dance with me
Dance with me, this night should never end at all

There's no fun in being clean
No place to be bombed like here, you know
It's hard for me to believe
You laugh as hard sober
There's a light in my eyes, and I can't see through
A venom in my blood so I don't feel blue
So I don't feel blue
Sunrise, still at the party
This game is killing me softly
But I need it, yeah I need it, yeah I need it now

(Blue) But the night is young
(Blue) But the night is young
Many things yet to be done for fun
Set the room on fire (on fire)
We could still get higher
This night should never end at all
Dance with me, you, dance with me
Just dance with me
Dance with me, this night should never end at all
Dance with me, you, dance with me
Just dance with me
Dance with me, this night should never end at all
