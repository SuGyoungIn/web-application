With their groove-infused rock and catchy melodies, HEY LIFE draw their inspiration from the British alternative scene and seek one thing: Rally the crowd through their tunes forged for the stage.

The positive vibe and energy of the five frenchies transpire their only concern, make the crowd move!

The band is releasing their first EP “Masquerade” on December 7th and will perform throughout 2019.
