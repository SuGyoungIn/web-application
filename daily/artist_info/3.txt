Tea-drinker, singer-songwriter, producer: Diamond Eyes shines in many directions.

He’s explored the exciting possibilities of more pop style compositions with tragically missed pop sensation Christina Grimmie (‘Stay With Me’), an anthemic juggernauts that heavily characterised bass music in 2015. After a two year sabbatical, Diamond Eyes made one of the most remarkable returns in 2018 with ‘Everything’.
