[Verse]
I was ready to surrender my heart to you, only you
These lights all around me keep blinding my eyes from you and the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell me, don’t tell me, don't tell me why
I know, I know no you won't save my life, save my life
If you keep on, you keep on, you’re making the waves
You and I will never be sane, be sane

[Chorus]
If these walls come down
Will you pick me off the ground?
If these walls come down
Will you save me or burn me down?

[Drop]
Will you pick me off the ground?
Will you save me or burn me down?
Will you pick me off the ground?
Will you save me or burn me down?

[Verse]
I was ready to surrender my heart to you, only you
These lights all around me keep blinding my eyes from you and the truth
