[Verse 1]
Broke into pieces I fall
When I collect myself, you better run like hell
Stoking in the flames of mine tall
And when I'm out my cell, you better pray for help

[Chorus]
Welcome to my evolution
Leveling up, leveling up
Welcome to my evolution
Leveling up, leveling up

[Drop]
My evolution

[Post-Drop]
Oh
My evolution

[Verse 2]
Chosen I follow the call
My soul is breaking free, you awaken me
Stolen my time to move on
But now I can see, sеizing destiny

[Chorus]
Welcome to my еvolution
Leveling up, leveling up
Welcome to my evolution
Leveling up, leveling up
