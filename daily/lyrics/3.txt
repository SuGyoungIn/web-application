I can't wait to leave this town
'Cause lately I've been feeling down
The cold nights just don't feel the same

Pack my life inside a car
Hit the road and drive real far
Put that record on we like

I’m dreaming of you, I dream of a new life
We’ll fight in the dark till we see the sunlight
My love it’s you & I
No one comes close who can ride this vibe
So reach for the stars cause we’re aiming high

You can’t wait to see me now
'Cause lately you've been feeling down
You lay awake alone at night

Pack your life inside a car
Forget the world and drive real far
Put that record on again

My love it’s you & I
No one comes close who can ride this vibe
So reach for the stars cause we’re aiming high
