[Verse 1]
A broken glass while I'm thinking in my head
I mind my own, I don't even break a sweat, oh

[Chorus]
This menace is insane
Why you still live in vain?
I'm not the one, you're the victim of your own mistakes
It's sad to hear the lies
Under the street lights
Under the street lights

[Drop]
I'm not the one, you're the victim of your own mistakes

[Verse 2]
Untold stories, they were left behind
The silent breeze, I got nothing on my mind

[Chorus]
This menace is insane
Why you still live in vain?
I'm not the onе, you're the victim of your own mistakes
It's sad to hеar the lies
Under the street lights
Under the street lights
