[Verse]
I shut the door
All of the nonsense
That you, all that you put me through
I give it all to you
I do it all for you
Maybe this feeling's overdue

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah I didn't fight it
You wanna hold me close
But I'm not what you would do
Nah yeah, yeah, yeah
What are you hiding?
Tell me, what must I do?
Come to you or come to you?

[Chorus]
You're mine, mine, mine
It's right, right, right
It's right, right, right, right now
What are you hiding?
Tell me what must I do?
Come to you or come to you?

[Drop]
You're mine, mine, mine
It's right, right, right
It's right, right, right, right now
What are you hiding?
Tell me what must I do?
Come to you or come to you?
