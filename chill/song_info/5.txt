The girl group "IVE (IVE)," which has received keen attention even before its debut, will take its first step into the K-pop scene.
IVE is a girl group consisting of 6 members, including leader Yujin, Gaeul, Rey, Wonyoung, Leeds, and Iseo.
Like the meaning of "I HAVE = IVE," it contains the confident charm of independent girls.
