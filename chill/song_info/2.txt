The digital single "Merry-go-round" is a collaboration between composer Kang Ji-won and Kim Ki-beom, who have been working together since their debut album, and attempted to harmonize untouchable dynamic rap with acoustic instruments, with Monday Kids Jin Sung's vocal and pianist Min-ji's performance.

Untouchable tries to promote hip-hop, which was classified as a non-mainstream in the popular music market, by attempting a new music style every time. I look forward to the future of Untouchable, who once again visited the public with emotional hip-hop.
