There is no correct answer in all literature, but among them, poetry is the most free from restrictions on interpretation.
As long as it contains only the purity of the artist, everything is poetic in any form.
The reason why I'm a little scared of embarrassing expressions such as "Poet," "Art," "Inspiration," and "Work," and I'm not ashamed of the name of the album even though I shamelessly named it "Love Poem" is because everything here is sincere.
