The characteristic of this mini-album is that you can see Rosie's growth process from a girl to a lady. Along with pre-debut songs that allow you to feel curiosity and empathy for self-discovery, Rothy, who turned 20, expressed another perspective and value through her new song Burning and Finding Lost Time. This album is expected to arouse a lot of sympathy among the public living in the same era as Rosie.
