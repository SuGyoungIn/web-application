If I changed everything
The way I walk, the way I breathe
Will my fate shift into the night?
But here I am, same old thing
Sinking deep, no ecstasy
Reality haunts the living mind
If I saw another day
Only to scream into the night
Nothing ever tries to change
Even if I want to realign
'Cause I've been sitting here, same old ways
Taking off without the same mistakes
Darling, where you're going?
Won't be a simple voyage
Time won't change anything
If I don't know how to greet
The current that pushеd against the tide
Maybe oncе, maybe twice
I turned around to save the time
Now I know how to lead the sign
If I saw another day
Only to scream into the night
Nothing ever tries to change
Even if I want to realign
'Cause I've been sitting here, same old ways
Taking off without the same mistake
Can I leave it all behind?
Follow all the leading signs
When the dark is growing
And the light is closing
Darling, where you're going?
Won't be a simple voyage
