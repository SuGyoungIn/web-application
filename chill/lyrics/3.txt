I can't wait to leave this town
'Cause lately I've been feeling down
The cold nights just don't feel the same
Ohohhhhh
Pack my life inside a car
Hit the road and drive real far
Put that record on we like
Ohohhhhh
I'm dreaming of you, I dream of a new life, ooh
We'll fight in the dark till we see the sunlight
My love it's you and I
No one comes close who can ride this vibe, ooh
So reach for the stars cause we're aiming high
You can't wait to see me now
Cause lately you've been feeling down
You lay awake alone at night
Ohohhhhh
Pack your life inside a car
Forget the world and drive real far
Put that record on again
Ohohhhhh
My love it's you and I
No one comes close who can ride this vibe
So reach for the stars cause we're aiming high
I'm dreaming of you, I dream of a new life, ooh
We'll fight in the dark till we see the sunlight
My love it's you and I
No one comes close who can ride this vibe, ooh
So reach for the stars cause we're aiming high
I can't wait to leave this town
I can't wait to leave this town, cause lately I've been feeling down
