[Verse 1]
It's like I got that sinking
Sinking in my stomach from that love (From that love)
Of course it's got me thinking
Thinking's got me flummoxed from the cause

[Chorus]
I just wanna know why
Some of us are guarded
I just wanna know why
Some of us are haunted
Closer than the sky is
All we ever wanted
(All we ever wanted)
All of us got distracted
By the trees inside the forest
'Cause I was never ready for this

[Drop]
'Cause I can't tell where my heart is
'Cause I was never ready for this
'Cause I can't tell where my heart is
'Cause I was never ready for this

[Verse 2]
It's like I get those feelings
Feelings weighing heavy on my heart
(Feelings weighing heavy on my heart)
It's hard to find the reasons
Reasons here for everything gone wrong
