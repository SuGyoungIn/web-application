[Verse 1]
Hey Mr. Bully
Won't you just see right through me
On the dying days when I ask for forgiveness on my soul?

Hey Mr. Bully
What'd you think when you push me
Out of my own head where everything made sense?

[Hook]
Breathing in
The lies that keep me open
From the truth that keeps me holding on, holding on to your loss
Where do you think you'll find me
When you destroy what is inside me?
I'll carry on

[Pre-Drop]
Say it's over
When nothing's closer to
What you're fighting for

[Verse 2]
Fade away from where we've been
I close the chapter where I ripping out my pages
Stop the fire under my skin
Or light the blaze again that stood alive for ages
