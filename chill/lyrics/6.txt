[Chorus]
The lights in my head aren't shining no more
I don't know if I can do this anymore
If there is a sun, I will run away
If there is a way, I will never stay, never stay here

[Pre-Drop]
Never stay here
Never stay here
Never stay here

[Drop]

[Chorus]
The lights in my head aren't shining no more
I don't know if I can do this anymore
If there is a sun, I will run away
If there is a way, I will never stay, never stay here

[Pre-Drop]
Nеver stay here
Nеver stay here
Never stay here
