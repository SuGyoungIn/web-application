[Verse 1]
Whispers in my mind
Are slowly drifting by
All the poems I wrote for you
They made me blind, they made me lie

[Chorus]
Heard you in the rain
Will you always be there?
The last thing you said
Sorry if it's too late
Sorry if it's too late

[Drop]

[Chorus]
Heard you in the rain
Will you always be there?
The last thing you said
Sorry if it's too late
Sorry if it's too late

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Gray and cloudy skies and waves of violent stars
Between these two worlds
You tried to find your own
I tried to run, I tried to hide, I needed to survive
(I needed to survive)
