Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hmm
Ooh, mmm
Ooh
I used to sleep with open eyes
I used to breathe just to keep us alive
Now all I can see is we're drifting apart
I can't believe how it all turned dark
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
I can't believe how it all turned dark
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
The light
Bring me the light
When the night is falling I feel the darkness calling
Like I'm afraid to love, no one can see me now
When the night is falling I feel the darkness calling
Like I'm afraid to love, no one can see me now
No one can see me now
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
Bring me the light
I can't believe how it all turned dark
Bring me the light
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hmm
Ooh, mmm
Ooh
Bring me the light
