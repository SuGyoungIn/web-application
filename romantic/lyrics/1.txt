Oh my baby
Got me starin' at ya
So I'm crazy
Won't you bend that back for me
We won't stop
Got your feet both locked
You get to fly with me
I can take you down for a ride
I take you around my life
Jay-walking, cross-walking, lip-locking with you
I know it, you know it, we make it
I can take you down for a ride
I take you around my life
Jay-walking, cross-walking, lip-locking with you
I know it, you know it, we make it
Oh my baby
So I'm crazy
