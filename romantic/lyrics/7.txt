The truth is a damn hard pill to swallow
I'm reaching out, but all I feel is hollow
I wanna make you work, but all I do is make you worse
The truth is a damn hard pill to swallow
Don't you wanna come on over?
Don't you wanna work it out?
Don't you wanna love me better
Love me better, love me now?
Don't you wanna fix our problems?
Baby, I can show you how
Don't you wanna love me better
Love me better, love me now?
Don't you wanna come on over?
Don't you wanna work it out?
Don't you wanna love me better
Love me better, love me now?
Don't you wanna fix our problems?
Baby, I can show you how
Don't you wanna lovе me better
Lovе me better, love me now?
Don't you wanna love me better
Love me better, love me now?
Don't you wanna come on over?
Don't you wanna work it out?
Don't you wanna love me better
Love me better, love me now?
Don't you wanna fix our problems?
Baby, I can show you how
Don't you wanna love me better
Love me better, love me now?
Don't you wanna love me better
Love me better, love me now?
