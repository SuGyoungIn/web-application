Who or what are you now looking for?
I got to believe my love wasn't enough
You are in every dream, in everything I lay my eyes on
What are you looking for when you look at me?
You gotta know
I was never enough
I was never enough
You are in every dream, in everything I lay my eyes on
What are you looking for when you look at me?
You gotta know
I was never enough
