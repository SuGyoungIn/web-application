I see a wanted man
Inside that deeper core
We’re all left to be lonely

What ever happens next
Won’t be remembered
They will leave us lonely

I ain’t no superman
But I will fight for you
When no one else would ever dare to

I ain’t no superman
But I will see it through
Cause no one else seems to care too

No one will be there to know
When this world is so cold

No one will see to know
When this world gets cold

I ain’t no superman
But I will fight for you
When no one else would ever dare to
I ain’t no superman
But I will see it through
Cause no one else seems to care too

No one will be there to know
When this world is so cold

I ain’t no superman

No one will see to know
When this world gets cold

I ain’t no superman
But I will fight for you
When no one else would ever dare to
