[Chorus]
Fuck can I catch a break
For a moment I
Need just a second I
Lost my direction

[Chorus]
Fuck can I catch a break
For a moment I
Need just a second I
Lost my

[Verse 1]
Self love
Use a little dreamin' just to get by
Use a little something for a good time
Take a look at all the things that you have


But I know
Clarity is pointless if it won't last
Plus I'm getting worse at moving forward
Why does making progress feel like going back

[Chorus]
Fuck can I catch a break
For a moment I
Need just a second I
Lost my direction
[Chorus]
Fuck can I catch a break
For a moment I
Need just a second I
Lost my direction

[Verse 2]
Instead of moving on
I'll overthink
Then overthink my overthinking

Take a breath, take a brеath now focus
Don't give up don't give up I'm almost through
You swear it's worth it in thе end right?

Yea I know yea I said I want this
There are so many things still left to do
I'm still so far from where I should be

[Chorus]
Fuck can I catch a break
For a moment I
Need just a second I
Lost my direction

(outro)
Fuck can I catch a break
For a moment I
Need just a second I
Lost my
Self love
Use a little dreamin' just to get by
Use a little something for a good time
Take a look at all the things that you have
