I wanna move away
To a place where can let go
I wanna settle down
With someone that just know me well

But I got you babe
And It’s all good
Little did I know
That she’d be a 10 out of 10

But I got you babe
And It’s all good
Little did I know
That she’d be a 10 out of 10

Still wearing all my clothes
Even if there all in wrong size
It doesn’t even matter

That is all I need
When the rest of the world is on fire
It doesn’t even matter

I want us to be safe
Never letting go of you hand
I fell into your faith
This Is the place will stay
But I got you babe
And It’s all good
Little did I know
That she’d be a 10 out of 10

But I got you babe
And It’s all good
Little did I know
That she’d be a 10 out of 10

Still wearing all my clothes
Even if there all in wrong size
It doesn’t even matter

That is all I need
When the rest of the world is on fire
It doesn’t even matter

Still wearing all my clothes
Even if there all in wrong size
It doesn’t even matter

That is all I need
When the rest of the world is on fire
It doesn’t even matter
