[Intro]
Aah, oh-aah, aah, aah
Aah, oh-aah, aah, aah

[Chorus]
I been crying so much to the poltergeists
Trying to hold onto love but it's frost and ice down here
So much but a light from a foreign sky (Ah-ah)
Reply to the forces above us like
Keep holding on to this present time
Inspired by the ones that were left behind us
When they fell for the light of a foreign sky (Ah-ah)
Replying to the forces above this life

[Bridge]
Aah, oh-ooh, aah-aah
Aah, oh-ooh, aah-aah

[Chorus]
Been crying so much to the poltergeists
Trying to hold onto love but it's frost and ice down here
So much but a light from a foreign sky (Ah-ah)
Reply to the forces above us like
Keep holding on to this present time
Inspired by the ones that were left behind us
When they fell for the light of a foreign sky
Replying to the forces above this life
[Outro]
Been crying so much to the poltergeists (Ah-ah)
Trying to hold onto love but it's frost and ice down here (Oh-aah)
So much but a light from a foreign sky (Ah-ah)
Reply to the forces above us like (Ah-ah)
Keep holding on to this present time (Ah-ah)
Inspired by the ones that were left behind us
When they fell for the light of a foreign sky (Ah-ah)
Replying to the forces above this life
