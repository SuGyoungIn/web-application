Standing here with the Army now
I've gotten orders from the top

Pack your armor, helicopters down
In the Desert it gets hot
They told us everyone would celebrate
But the champagne's flat, nobody's cutting cake

Silent Now
Bullets flying around
My life was ordinary once
Look what war made me become

I've been living with ghosts
Everywhere that I go
(Look what war made me become)
I've been living with ghosts
Got me here by the throat
(Look what war made me become)

Lying in bed, back home again
It feels familiar here I guess
Trying to find the way I felt back then
Before we got into this mess

They said our sacrifice was not in vain
Tell that to memories inside my brain
They told us everyone would celebrate
But the champagne's flat, nobody's cutting cake
Silent Now
Bullets flying around
My life was ordinary once
Look what war made me become
