[Chorus: Carl Storm]
Found in the dark
Broken and scarred
You were there for me
Gave you my heart
It was apart
You were the one I needed
Love like this is really hard to find
Guess I met you at the right time
Found in the dark
Broken and scarred
You were there for me
Gave you my heart
It was apart
You were the one I needed
Love like this is really hard to find
Guess I met you at the right time

[Verse: yaeow]
Gave you my heart
Broken to pieces
You fixed it again
But I wonder why I can't let you in
'Cause I love you but I can't see you through
Found in the dark
[Chorus: Carl Storm]
Found in the dark
Broken and scarred
You were there for me
Gave you my heart
It was apart
You were the one I needed
Love like this is really hard to find
Guess I met you at the right time
