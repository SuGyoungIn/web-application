Wherever we go
Oooh
We'll always know
Oooh
From the highest mountain
To the bottom of the ocean, yeah
Oooh
Our song is running like a river
Let the current take us there
We've got the melody
To set us free
Singin' destiny
We've got the melody
To set us free
Singin' destiny
Oooh
Oooh, destiny
Oooh, destiny
Our hearts are like stars
(Oooh)
Guiding us through the dark
(Oooh)
We've got the melody
To set us free
Singin' destiny
We've got the melody
To set us free
Singin' destiny
Oooh
Oooh, destiny
Oooh, destiny
Our hearts are like stars
Guiding us through the dark
(Oooh)
We've got the melody
To set us free
Singin' destiny
We've got the melody
To set us free
Singin' destiny
Oooh
Oooh, destiny
Oooh, destiny
