Chorus]
Oh, I can't see
The color running through your veins
And I can't breathe
When everything you do is pain
Love me

[Drop]

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't see
The color running through your veins
And I can't breathe
When everything you do is pain
Oh, I can't see
The color running through your veins
And I can't breathe
When everything you do is pain
Love me

[Drop]
