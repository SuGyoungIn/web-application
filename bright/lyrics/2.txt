[Verse 1]
I'll be your anything
If you'll be the one to take me home
'Cause right now everything
Makes my wanna leave this place and roam

[Chorus]
Make me feel alive
Take my hand and run, let me be the one
Let's just take the dive
Night's only begun, don't you think we're done
Don't you think we're done

[Drop]
Don't you think we're done
Don't you think we're done

[Verse 2]
Knew that it was true from thе way you looked at me
At me
Don't know what to do, what to say to makе you with me
With me

[Chorus]
Make me feel alive
Take my hand and run, let me be the one
Let's just take the dive
Night's only begun, don't you think we're done
Don't you think we're done
