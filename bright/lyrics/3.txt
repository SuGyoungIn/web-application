[Verse 1]
Shine bright, up all night
We're never slowing down
Fall in love, drunk mistakes
We're bound to hit the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta keep this feeling, keep on breathing
Even if we're slipping away
So I close my eyes and lose myself now
Do it like it's only today

[Chorus]
We got a party for a lifetime (Oh, oh)
No we ain't stopping for the sunrise (Oh, oh)
And we don't care about the bad nights (Oh, oh)
If for a second I can feel like this
Make me feel like this

[Drop]
We got a party for a lifetime (Oh, oh)
No we ain't stopping for the sunrise (Oh, oh)
And we don't care about the bad nights (Oh, oh)
If for a second I can feel like this
Make me feel like this
