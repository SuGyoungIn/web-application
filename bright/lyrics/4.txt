[Chorus]
Let’s take it slow
Where you go, I go too
And if you hit the bottom, I’m going down with you
Let’s take it slow
Who cares where we gotta be
You know you’ll have a good time, wherever you’re with me
Let’s take it

[Verse]
You ask me how we got here ‘cause you don’t know how
You say we’re taking on water, yeah we’re sinking now
You’re looking all concerned like we’re gonna drown
But we both know how to swim, no worries let’s float for now

[Chorus]
Let’s take it slow
Where you go, I go too
And if you hit the bottom, I’m going down with you
Let’s take it slow
Who cares where we gotta be
You know you’ll have a good time, wherever you’re with me
Let’s take it

[Verse]
I know I’m not easy; I drive you out your mind
And there are days I hate you, but baby you’re still mine
And man we have the best times, no matter what we do
And even when we don’t, there’s nobody I’d rather choose
