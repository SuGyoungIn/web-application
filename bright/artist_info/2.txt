Hey!

I have been working as a ghost producer, while studying violin in Berlin and at the royal danish music conservatory in Copenhagen for the last couple of years. I now decided to start my own project under the artist name 'LÃ¸v Li' to be able to focus on making exactly the music I love.

Growing up playing the violin and the piano I was exposed to a lot of film music composers such as Hans Zimmer and Steve Jablonsky but also to the electro pop music my friends would listen to. Both of these genres have majorly influenced the way I write and produce my songs, incorporating both electronic beats and acoustic instruments such as lush strings, piano and guitar to achieve the sound-universe I enjoy.
