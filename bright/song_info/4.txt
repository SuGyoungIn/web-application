With their debut single "RIDE" and Jooyoung's "Feat. SOLE," they imprinted their unique voice colors on the public.
Singer-songwriter SOLE has returned with his second single "Slow."

The simple arrangement of piano, drum, bass, etc. reduces musical greed as much as possible.
"Slow" is SOLE's autobiographical story that comforts and messages only with SOLE's voice, melody, and lyrics.
It is a record of the process of healing oneself, or a song for everyone who is tired.
